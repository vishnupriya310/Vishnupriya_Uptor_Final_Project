Project Overview: Candidate Performance Analysis

As a part of the Learning & Development (L&D) department,
I am exploring the possibility of working on a simple project focused on analyzing candidate performance.

For this project, I am using a student performance dataset, which includes the following columns:

Student_ID

Age
Gender
Study_Hours_per_Week
Preferred_Learning_Style
Online_Courses_Completed
Participation_in_Discussions
Assignment_Completion_Rate (%)
Exam_Score (%)
Attendance_Rate (%)
Use_of_Educational_Tech
Self_Reported_Stress_Level
Time_Spent_on_Social_Media (hours/week)
Sleep_Hours_per_Night
Final_Score

Objective:
The goal of this project is to train and analyze the relationship between the Time Spent on Social Media (hours/week) and Final Score to understand the impact of social media usage on student performance.

Approach:
We aim to use a Supervised Learning model, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict the Final Score of a candidate based on the Time Spent on Social Media (hours/week). The model will be trained using labeled data, where the input features are associated with the corresponding performance outcomes (Final Score).

Plan:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling numeric values.

Model Training: Implement and train the SVM model using the labeled dataset.

Analysis: Evaluate the model's performance and analyze how the time spent on social media correlates with the final score, and how other factors might impact candidate performance.

This project will help in understanding how certain behaviors and habits, like time spent on social media, affect overall academic performance, providing valuable insights for improving candidate outcomes.
